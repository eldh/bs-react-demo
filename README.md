# BsReact Demo

This is the code from a live-coding presentation at #ReasonSTHLM on Dec 11 2018. The interesting bits are in `src/App.re` and `src/Fetch.re`.

## Speaker notes

- React has added some seriously cool stuff lately
- ReasonReact has some missing features
  - Context
  - Error boundaries
  - Suspense
  - Hooks
- Hooks or Reason â€“ Why can't we have both!
- BsReact is a new set of bindings to React
- Hooks means you don't need classes
  - Everything is a function
  - Much simpler bindings
- Let's try it out
